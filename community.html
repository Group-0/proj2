		<center> <p>Classes</p>
	</h2>
	<p> In your classes, you will meet several peers and make new friends. Try to put yourself out there, help each other out, and ask questions. <br> Some of the people you meet in these classes could become your closest friends throughout your time here, so make the most of it! </p>
	
	
	
	
	<h2>
		<center> <p>Organizations</p>
	</h2>
	<p> There are more than 1,000 student organizations on campus. <br> Getting involved with an organization or club can help you meet people with similar <br> interests that are outside of your classes. If you don't see an organization that's for you, you can start a new one! </p>
